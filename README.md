# udk-creative-coding-processing
In this course we are going to explore computational thinking through coding. We will start from scratch, learning how to represent colors, line, shapes and 2D text. We will then learn about logical operators, arrays, vectors, forces and and how to use them to create our own drawing algorithms. The course will use Processing as programming language and it is addressed to beginners.


## Intro to Creative Coding
Slides about computer graphic, intro to Processing and the IDE.

## Shapes

Description: Learn how to draw 2D geometric shapes. Learn how to read the [reference page](https://processing.org/reference/).

Keywords: `cartesian plane`,  `circle`, `rect`, `variables`,`local variables`, `global variables`, `size`, `noLoop`, `60 FPS`

Applications: `first`

### Exercises:
- Draw your initials with primitive shapes and lines.
- Choose a painting from Mondrian, try to replicate it. If it feels too easy, try to replicate "On White II, 1923", by Kandinsky. Use a program as GIMP or photoshop to pick exactly the color
- Take a picture with your phone, try to simplify its content, try to draw it using the primitive shapes you have learned.

## Colors

Description: Learn how to create colors and and how to change them.

Keywords: `background()`, `stroke()`, `fill()`, `noStroke()`, `noFill()`, `colorMode`, `HSB`, `RGB`,`transparency and alpha channels`,

Application: `colors`, `colors-blendMode`, 

### Exercise(s)
- Create your own palette, invent your own animation.

## Interact with mouse and keyboard

Description: Add interactivity to your sketches reading the mouse position or getting events from your keyboard.

### Exercises
- Make an application with the function `noLoop()` in the setup method. Re draw something on screen everytime a key on your keyboard is pressed. Everytime you draw, the composition should be slightly different.

## Logical operators, comparison operator, loop and conditions

Description: Learn how to compare two variables, how to make a branch condition, how to make a loop.

Keywords: `||`, `&&`, `>`, `<`, `>=`. 

Exercises:

- Make a sketch where the value of a variable is changing continuosly and you compare this value with a fixed variable. Use comparison operator or logical operator to change the visual output of your sketch.
- Make an application and draw a square. Change the background color when the mouse is over the square.
